BUILD INSTRUCTIONS - Jellyfin.Plugin.DirectShow (updated)

1) Edit NuGet.config and replace:
   - GITHUB-USERNAME with your GitHub username
   - YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN with a Personal Access Token that has 'read:packages' permission

2) From the project folder (where the .csproj file is located) run:
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build --configuration Release

Notes:
- This repository uses NuGet.org and GitHub Packages as package sources (Jellyfin packages are hosted on GitHub Packages).
- The plugin targets net8.0 and Jellyfin ABI 10.9.0.0. Adjust 'manifest.json' if you target a different Jellyfin version.
- I could not run 'dotnet restore' or 'dotnet build' inside this environment; the zip I provide contains updated project files ready for you to build locally or in GitHub Actions.
